# WoW Audit Auto Sims

## Overview
This project automates the process of running Raidbots simulations for World of Warcraft characters and uploads the results to WoW Audit. It utilizes Selenium to navigate Raidbots' web interface, starts simulations, polls for completion, and updates WoW Audit with the best gear wishlist.

## Features
- Fetches character and raid information from WoW Audit.
- Starts Raidbots Droptimizer simulations via a headless browser.
- Polls the simulation job status until completion.
- Uploads the generated wishlist to WoW Audit.
- Processes multiple characters asynchronously.
- The script currently processes only non-healer characters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome or Firefox
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- WoW Audit API token (set as an environment variable `WOWAUDIT_API_TOKEN`)
